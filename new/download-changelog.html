  <li>Add "next" and "prev" as possible <monitor> targets in the moveto and resizeto actions.</li>
  <li>Allow escaping the _ used to mark the shortcut character in menu labels. You can now change the (first) _ in a label to __, this will be displayed as a single underscore. The rest of the _ in the string will be unaffected, so only double the first one.</li>
  <li>Only replace ~ with the home directory when it is preceded by whitespace or is at the start of the string, and when it is followed by a space, slash, or the end of the string. This is implemented with GRegex, and so the required glib version has been bumped to 2.14.</li>
  <li>Some other small fixes.</li>
</ul>

<a name="3.4.8-rc1"><h5 class="text">3.4.8-rc1</h5></a><ul>
  <li>Updated translations: Basque, Catalan, Turkish, Italian, Spanish, Russian.</li>
  <li>New translations: Danish, Turkish, Lithuanian.</li>
  <li>Set the _MOTIF_WM_INFO atom so urxvt uses motif hints for borderless mode.</li>
  <li>Properly escape the xml used in session files.</li>
  <li>Correct a 64-bit issue related to comparing timestamps.</li>
  <li>There is a sneaky sentence right at the end of a big paragraph in the wm-spec document that says windows mapping with _NET_WM_USER_TIME=0 should not be focused initially, honor this request.</li>
  <li>When moving a window to another desktop with following on, bring the window's helper windows (for example gimp image windows with the toolbox set to utility window).</li>
  <li>Change the _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW messages again, if they originate from the app and the window is on another desktop, just set the demands_attention flag. If the event came from the user (ie pager/panel), then the window is still moved to the current desktop.</li>
</ul>

<a name="3.4.7.2"><h5 class="text">3.4.7.2</h5></a><ul>
  <li>The system I used to generate the dist tarball didn't have the docbook-to-man command so the manpages were empty.</li>
</ul>

<a name="3.4.7.1"><h5 class="text">3.4.7.1</h5></a><ul>
  <li>Not to be outdone by the cairo team, I introduced a bug in the last release which made resizing not give any feedback. This is now fixed.</li>
</ul>

<a name="3.4.7"><h5 class="text">3.4.7</h5></a><ul>
  <li>Fully updated Czech, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, German, French, Hungarian, Norwegian, Vietnamese, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese and Portuguese translations</li>
  <li>Partially updated Spanish translation</li>
  <li>Add an example of the "force" option for the per-app placement options to the default rc.xml file</li>
  <li>Add a new xdg-autostart script.  This will eventually end up in the PyXDG distribution hopefully, but it is included in Openbox for now.  This script runs things based on the freedesktop.org autostart specification.  You can have it run GNOME, KDE, ROX, or XFCE specific things if you want.  The new default system-wide autostart.sh script runs it automatically</li>
  <li>Update the default menu.xml to include a lot of common apps</li>
  <li>Fix white font shadows (negative shadowtint)</li>
  <li>Update the autostart.sh to find gnome-settings-daemon correctly, as the GNOME people have moved it to libexec</li>
  <li>Fix focus possibly getting stolen when using the Focus action</li>
  <li>Drastically speed up rendering of Vertical and SplitVertical gradients</li>
  <li>Speed improvements also for Horizonal and Pyramid gradients</li>
  <li>Add new theme options, menu.overlap.x and menu.overlap.y options, that let you independently control the horizontal and vertical position of submenus</li>
  <li>Change _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW messages to not change the current desktop, but to bring the window to the current desktop instead.  This is the industry standard policy</li>
  <li>Use the pretty new openbox.png icon as the default window icon</li>
  <li>Allow matching per-application rules to windows by their window type (normal, dialog, splash, etc).  The default rc.xml has more details</li>
  <li>Add new Openbox-themed prompt windows.  Use these prompt windows to ask before killing off windows that aren't responding.  This also means we don't need to ping every window constantly forever</li>
  <li>Add a new &lt;prompt&gt; option to the Execute action.  If this is set to a string, a dialog will be shown with that string in it and "yes"/"no" buttons.  The command to be executed will only be run if the user selects "yes" in the dialog</li>
  <li>Add a new &lt;prompt&gt; option to the Exit action, which is a boolean (not a string).  When true, Openbox will show a dialog confirming if you want to exit.  The default is to show the prompt</li>
  <li>Reduce Openbox's memory footprint and speed up rendering through the use of a new icon cache, so that Openbox only needs to keep 1 copy of an icon when 100 different windows share it</li>
  <li>Make Openbox menus have the "menu type" hint for compositors to see and use</li>
  <li>Fix the MoveResizeTo action for negative coords (opposite edges)</li>
  <li>Fix key bindings getting lost if multiple bindings at the same level could not be translated (Fixes VMWare causing Openbox keybindings to stop working)</li>
  <li>Fix the resize popup box for terminal windows with a base size of 0 (show the right size values for urxvt terminals)</li>
  <li>Fix some off-by-one bugs with the edge growing/shrinking code</li>
  <li>Add new theme options for menu line separators: menu.separator.color, menu.separator.width, menu.separator.padding.width, menu.separator.padding.height</li>
  <li>Add xfce-mcs-manager to the default autostart.sh, and run it automatically when gnome-settings-daemon is not present to have GTK apps inherit settings from the XFCE configuration tools</li>
  <li>Make the send-to-desktop menu in the client-menu indicate which is the current desktop for omnipresent windows, and don't close it if just toggling omni-presence when ctrl-clicking</li>
  <li>Add a new SessionLogout action that logs out through the session manager, when running Openbox within a session manager such as within an GNOME/Openbox or KDE/Openbox session.  The action includes a &lt;prompt&gt; option which is similar to the Exit action's</li>
  <li>Add a new gdm-control command that lets you control gdm from within an X session.  The gdm-control lets you change GDM's behaviour for when you end the current session.  For instance, you can tell GDM to reboot, and then immediately log out of the current session, and the computer will be rebooted</li>
  <li>Show an information dialog when an error occurs for Openbox, such as when the Execute action fails or when XML syntax errors are present in the configuration files</li>
  <li>When making a window very narrow, don't draw buttons to the right of the title on top of the ones on its left.</li>
</ul>

<a name="3.4.6.1"><h5 class="text">3.4.6.1</h5></a><ul>
  <li>Updated Clearlooks theme</li>
  <li>Add the force="yes/no" option for the per-app settings' &lt;position&gt; tag</li>
  <li>Raise and focus modal children and their direct parents together, improved usability with direct modal transient windows</li>
  <li>Fix crash when using &lt;raise&gt; for NextWindow and there are no windows to move focus to</li>
  <li>Add the &lt;manageDesktops&gt; option in the rc.xml &lt;menu&gt; section, which toggles the "Manage Desktops" section appearing in the combined-client-list-menu</li>
  <li>Fix for menu headers showing the wrong text</li>
  <li>Fix for the &lt;focusLast&gt; behavior</li>
  <li>Treat modal direct children as one window with their parent consistently</li>
</ul>

<a name="3.4.6"><h5 class="text">3.4.6</h5></a><ul>
  <li>Added Basque translation</li>
  <li>Updated French, Vietnamese German, Simplified Chinese, Russian, Portuguese, Brasilian Portuguese, Norwegian, and Finnish translations</li>

  <li>Improve the LastDesktop action to not remember desktops you skipped across</li>
  <li>Ignore mouse clicks that are made on override-redirect (unmanaged) windows</li>
  <li>When opening a menu with a key binding, don't use the key binding to run something in the menu</li>
  <li>Add a &lt;monitor&gt; option for window placement, which gives you the option to place new windows on the active monitor, or the monitor where the mouse is, instead of on any monitor (for xinerama multihead setups)</li>
  <li>Add options for placing the window move/resize coordinate popu window in a fixed position on screen, rather than relative to the window being moved or resized</li>
  <li>Prevent the dock from auto-hiding completely offscreen if the theme has no borders for it</li>
  <li>New icon</li>
  <li>Fix race condition when running things that want to grab the keyboard (e.g. gnome-panel-control --main-menu)</li>
  <li>When dialog windows ask to not appear in the taskbar, still give them focus in normal ways (fixes new GNOME session logout dialogs)</li>
  <li>Fix bug with resizing corners on certain parts of the window frame</li>
  <li>Ping applications to tell when they are running or have become frozen.  Show a [Not Responding] message in the title bar of windows which are frozen.</li>
  <li>When closing a window which is [Not Responding], kill the window's process if it is running on the same machine as Openbox.  Otherwise, just disconnect the window from the X display.  A second attempt to close a [Not Responding] window will kill it forcefully (kill -9).</li>
  <li>Fixes for internal timers</li>
  <li>Add a &lt;wmclass&gt; option for the execute action's startup-notification.  This lets you tell Openbox that the application will map a window with the specified class - for applications that do not support startup-notification natively.</li>
  <li>Fix for empty dock taking up space onscreen after a reconfigure</li>
  <li>Reduce Openbox's additional memory footprint per-window and per-menu</li>
  <li>Faster horizontal gradient rendering</li>
  <li>Don't deiconify windows that aren't allowed to be directly iconified on restart (eg toolbars), as they can be iconified by other means</li>
  <li>Improve support for fullscreen windows in xinerama (TwinView) and multiple-screen setups</li>
  <li>Add a --config-file command line option, to specify an alternate configuration file path</li>
</ul>

  <li>Hide the desktop popup when showing the focus popup</li>
  <li>Fix a crash when trying to access the More... menu of client-list-combined-menu</li>
  <li>Fix the coordinate popup only showing up on the first monitor in xinerama</li>
  <li>Add --exit to exit the currently running openbox instance</li>
</ul>

  <li>Updated Norwegian translation</li>
  <li>Fix for MoveToEdge skipping edges sometimes</li>

  <li>Fix to keep oldschool (Non-EWMH) fullscreen windows from being moved and resized inside of the struts (Fixes Acroread)</li>
  <li>Accept the &lt;command&gt; option for the Restart command, similar to the Execute action</li>
  <li>Don't make clicking on dock apps sometimes act like clicking on the root window (Don't propogate button events up)</li>
  <li>Fix a bug introduced in 3.4.3 which caused the Windows key as a modifier for bindings to not work properly</li>
  <li>Let windows skip across monitors in a Xinerama setup when using MoveToEdge or Shift-arrow in an interactive move</li>

  <li>Raise new windows when it makes sense, when they aren't being focused</li>
  <li>Change default config to use click events for mouse wheel bindings instead of presses</li>

  <li>Add Ukrainian translation</li>
  <li>Updated translations: Japanese, Dutch, Polish, Italian, Estonian, German, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Finnish, Czech, Arabic, Spanish, Swedish, French</li>
  <li>Improve focus fallback - don't fallback to windows you can't focus cycle (Alt-Tab) to</li>
  <li>Don't show the client border for undecorated windows when keepBorder is on, just the outer border</li>
  <li>Some improvements in the smart placement to help it find a place more often.  This needs more work still.</li>

  <li>Don't focus new helper windows unless they are alone in their group.  This fixes gucharmap</li>
  <li>Fancy keyboard window moving:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Shift-arrow will move the window to the next edge</li>
    <li>Control-arrow will move the window by only 1 pixel</li>
    <li>Arrow will move the window by a larger number of pixels</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Fancy keyboard window resizing:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The first arrow will choose an edge to resize (then you can grow or shrink the window on that edge)</li>
    <li>Hitting an arrow perpendicular to your selected edge will choose a different edge to resize</li>
    <li>Shift-arrow will grow/shrink the window to the next edge</li>
    <li>Control arrow will grow/shrink the window by only 1 pixel</li>
    <li>Arrow will grow/shrink the window by a larger number of pixel</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Timeout when synchronously resizing a window so you can still resize busy or dead application windows</li>

  </ul>
  <li>Add user-specified margins to the configuration file</li>

  <li>Require libstartupnotification 0.8 in configure (we use stuff that was not around in some earlier versions)</li>
  <li>Grab the server when mapping windows to avoid race conditions in other programs (getting MapNotify before you are visible)</li>
  <li>Handle case gracefully when ConfigureRequent for restacking specifies a sibling which we aren't managing</li>
  <li>Use KeyRelease to run things from Openbox menus, so that the release does not go to the focused window (causing the new window to not get focus)</li>

  <li>End move/resize more cleanly when focus moves during a move/resize</li>
  <li>Don't focus new windows when browsing a menu or moving/resizing a window, just flash the window instead, so that the menu/move/resize doesn't have to cancel</li>

  <li>Translations for de, hr and zh_TW added.</li>
  <li>Add initial per-app settings support.</li>
  <li>Fix some outstanding issues with 64-bit support.</li>

  <li>Plug some minor memleaks and fix minor bugs.</li>
  <li>Changed algorithm for downscaling window icons.</li>
  <li>New themes!</li>

  <li>Fixed some typos and errors in rc.xsd</li>
  <li>Add the noStrut option to the dock (to allow maximizing windows over it), useful when it is not in the above layer.</li>
  <li>Fix transparent terminals not updating when using ToggleDecor.</li>
  <li>Yet more poking at the onscreen-keeping code, should now do the right thing always.</li>
  <li>Add an option to hide disabled buttons instead of showing them as disabled.</li>

  <li>I think the lib linking in Makefile.am is right now, please tell me if it isn't.</li>
  <li>Added a finnish translation and some minor updates to others.</li>
  <li>Fixed configure.ac so --enable-pango doesn't disable pango support or the other way around, make enabled be default to get some extra testing.</li>

<a name="3.3-rc1"><h5 class="text">3.3-rc1</h5></a><ul>
  <li>Poked around a bit in the code that keeps windows onscreen, if you are using xinerama, please let me know if things are better/worse/same.</li>
  <li>Add support for pango, disabled by default due to a bug in pango 1.8 that breaks shadows, it works fine with 1.6.x though. Poke the pango developers here http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169622 if you want this to be fixed.</li>

  <li>Hopefully no more of the hanging X totally bug</li>
  <li>the fullscreen property now overrides aspect hints, all programs i've tried that use it (mplayer and tvtime) handle the aspect internally anyway, this just makes sure you have black borders all the way to the edge. If this breaks anything for you, let me know.</li>
  <li>Added M as an alias for Mod3 in the same manner that W is an alias for Mod4</li>
  <li>Added probably too many options and actions</li>
  <li>ToggleDockAutohide to toggle the autohide option at runtime, doesn't save it to the config</li>
  <li>keepBorder option to set if you want the 1-pixel border when you toggleDecorations</li>
  <li>added popupShow and popupPosition to control where and when the move/resize-popup is shown, these go in the resize section of the config popupPosition can be Top or Center, popupShow can be Always, Never or Nonpixel (this is the default).</li>
  <li>Added the xorStyle option to change the behaviour of menus along the bottom edge, note that the default is true</li>
  <li>warpPointer option in the menu section to control if the mouse cursor is to be warped by openbox when the menu moves to keep on screen to keep the cursor in the same place relative to the menu. (I think i got that right)</li>
  <li>Added back the focusLast option (this controls what happens when you change desktops and have followMouse on)</li>
  <li>Added an option to set which desktop to start on when you start openbox, firstdesk, for example you might like to set it to 5 if you have a 3x3 grid to start in the middle.</li>
