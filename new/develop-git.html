<a name="quick"><h5 class="text">Quick Instructions</h5></a>

<p>
To get up and running, you just need one command. This will create a directory
called openbox and download the git repository into it:
</p>
<blockcode>
git clone git://git.openbox.org/dana/openbox openbox
</blockcode>

<p>To get the latest changes, from inside the downloaded git repository, run</p>
<blockcode>
git pull
</blockcode>

<p>
Note however that this only does what you expect if you haven't made any changes.
If you have, it will attempt to merge your changes which may or may not be what
you want, see <a href="#local">Local Changes</a> below.
</p>

<p>
Read the <code>README.GIT</code> file for instructions on building the
source code from the git repository.
</p>

<a name="branches"><h5 class="text">Branches</h5></a>

<p>
Currently, there are two branches of interest in the Openbox git repos:
master and 3.4-working. Master is the branch that will most likely become
Openbox 3.5 or so, 3.4-working keeps compatibility with the rc.xml file from
the 3.4.x releases. There is also a branch called backport which is where we
put fixes and features that should go in both the other branches.
</p>

<p>
By default you will get the master branch, hence the name. If you want the
3.4-working branch, run
</p>
<blockcode>
git checkout --track -b 3.4-working origin/3.4-working
</blockcode>

<p>
You can now switch between them with git checkout master and git checkout
3.4-working.
</p>

<p>
If you want the very latest changes, first decide if you want 3.4-working or master,
then check if we've recently merged the backport branch, for example by checking
the output of git-log, looking at gitk --all or at the gitweb interface (look
near the bottom under the "heads" header). If there are any interesting changes
in the backport branch you want, just run
</p>
<blockcode>
git merge origin/backport
</blockcode>

<p>
and git will pull in the changes for you. If it did not succeed or if the result
didn't compile, you should wait for us to merge it instead. Note however that a
git pull will not remerge backport for you, it will only get updates from the
branch you're currently on. If there are new commits on backport just rerun the
merge command. If you've merged backport, you might want to reset your master
branch before rerunning git pull. (this will remove local changes, so make
sure they're committed on another branch as detailed below if you have those).
</p>
<blockcode>
git reset --hard origin/3.4-working
</blockcode>

<p>
or if you're using master, type origin/master instead of course. And make sure
you've checked out the correct branch first. If you messed up, read
<code>man git-reflog</code>.
</p>

<a name="local"><h5 class="text">Local changes</h5></a>

<p>
Unlike CVS and Subversion, git lets you have local changes while still tracking
upstream development, in a nut shell, make your changes and run
</p>
<blockcode>
git commit -a -m "informative message"
</blockcode>

<p>
It's usually a good idea to keep your changes in a separate branch. You can do
this in a couple of ways, the easiest way is to run
</p>
<blockcode>
git checkout -b my-branch master
</blockcode>
<p>
then commit all your changes to that branch.
</p>

<a name="conflict"><h6 class="text">Conflicting changes</h6></a>

<p>
If you hang on to your changes for a long time, it's likely that
we will make commits that conflict with yours. There are two ways to
deal with this, you can either <code>git-merge</code> our branch and resolve the
differences, but the better way is to use <code>git-rebase</code>.
This command
will take your commits and apply them to the tip (ie latest version)
of the specified branch, pausing after each commit that conflicts.
This usually makes it easier to resolve the conflicts and also gives
a nicer history. Using git-rebase is a bit complicated so read the
man page.
</p>

<p>
If you just want to test that your changes work with the
latest version of openbox, you can merge master and then
later use <code>git reset --hard HEAD^</code> to revert
the merge. However, I recommend first doing a
<code>git checkout -b my-temp</code>, since running
git-reset twice will continue reverting real commits, so it's
easy to mess up. If you're doing all the temp merging on a
separate branch you don't have to worry about that.
</p>

<a name="contrib"><h5 class="text">Contributing code</h5></a>

<p>
You've coded an exciting feature and now you want to send a
diff, how to do it? git-diff you might guess, and while that
will produce a diff you can send, git-format-patch is a bit
nicer as it will automatically give you a patch file per commit
that you want to send, with the commit message in each file.
</p>

<p>
Another option is to set up your own public repo and simply tell
us where to pull your changes from, look at the git-daemon man
page for details. You can also use the git-bundle command to send
a file that contains all commits, which we can then pull from. For
example if you've made all your commits on the branch my-branch
which you produced at some point from <code>git checkout -b master</code>,
you can produce your bundle with
</p>
<blockcode>
git bundle create my-bundle master..my-branch
</blockcode>
<p>
then send the file my-bundle to us.
</p>

<a name="lowband"><h5 class="text">Low bandwidth option</h5></a>

<p>
If your internet connection is very slow (the full git
repo is currently around 8.5MB) and you just want the very
latest version without any history, you can run
</p>
<blockcode>
git clone --depth 1 git://git.openbox.org/dana/openbox openbox
</blockcode>

<p>
This will give you only the current and preceding commit from
each branch, but you can't do much more with your repo than compile
the code. Merging as described above will only work if you use a
depth high enough to include the point where the backport branch
separated from master. See the git-clone and git-fetch man pages
for further details.
</p>

<p>
You can also download a tarball of any revision via
<a href="http://git.openbox.org/?p=dana/openbox.git;a=summary">gitweb</a>.
Click "tree" next to a branch name at the bottom, then "snapshot" at the
top of the new page.
</p>

<a name="repos"><h5 class="text">Alternate repos</h5></a>

<p>
Due to the distributed nature of git, you can choose to pull
from various upstream locations (see the git-remote man page for
details on how to use several remotes).
</p>
<blockcode>git://git.openbox.org/dana/openbox</blockcode>
<blockcode>git://git.openbox.org/mikachu/openbox</blockcode>
<blockcode>git://git.mika.l3ib.org/openbox.git</blockcode>
<blockcode>git://repo.or.cz/openbox.git</blockcode>

<p>
The astute git user will notice that there are some variations in branches
offered among these, for example dana has a libs branch that separates out
some common wm code in a library, and mikachu has a mikabox branch which
is just some crazy stuff.

tutorials and all the man
pages are available for browsing as well.
