<p>Openbox is a minimalistic, highly configurable, next generation window manager with extensive standards support.
</p><p><b>Openbox is not Blackbox</b>. Openbox is not related to Blackbox in any way except for its visual appearance.
</p><p>Openbox originated as a fork of the Blackbox window manager at a time when a number of window managers forked off of Blackbox, such as Waimea and Fluxbox. Starting with Openbox version 3.0, however, Openbox has branched off to become its own style of window manager. The code was written entirely from scratch and bears no resemblance or relation to Blackbox any more.
</p><p>Openbox aims to be extremely standards compliant, following the ICCCM standard strictly, as well as throughly implementing support for the freedesktop.org window manager specification (EWMH).  Through these ends, Openbox is fully capable of being run under both the GNOME and KDE environments, and supports any and all applications which follow the same standards.
</p><p>Openbox is open source software, distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.  See the README and COPYING files in the distribution for further details.
</p><p>Most distributions of Linux include Openbox, see <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/help/Distros_and_DEs_using_Openbox" title="Help:Distros and DEs using Openbox">Help:Distros_and_DEs_using_Openbox</a> for more information.
