<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Root_menus"> Root menus </span></h2>
<p>If you are running Openbox on its own (not inside KDE or GNOME), the following will be available by clicking on the <b>desktop</b> (a.k.a. root window):
</p>
<table style="text-align:left">
<tr>
<th> Middle mouse button
</th>
<td> Open a menu listing all your windows
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th> Right mouse button
</th>
<td> Open a menu for launching applications (You should customize this menu to your liking)

<p>These may or may not be available if you use a program to give you icons on your desktop, depending on how it works.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Focus-follows-mouse"> Focus-follows-mouse </span></h2>
<p>If you enable focus-follows-mouse, the default settings are to delay focusing windows you enter with the mouse by 200ms (1/5 of a second).  This allows you to move across windows without focusing them.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Other_configurations"> Other configurations </span></h2>
<p>There are a number of <a href="Contents#Configuration" title="Help:Contents"> example configuration files here</a> which demonstrate some different ways to use Openbox.
